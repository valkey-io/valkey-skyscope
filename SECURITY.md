# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability, please contact the Valkey team at security@lists.valkey.io.
Please *DO NOT* create an issue.
We follow a responsible disclosure procedure, so depending on the severity of the issue we may notify Valkey vendors about the issue before releasing it publicly.
